🛠️ My Process

Built with
HTML5 - For the semantic structure
CSS3 - For styling and layout
Flexbox - For responsive design
Custom Fonts - For typography
What I learned
This project enhanced my understanding of semantic HTML and the use of Flexbox for layout positioning. I also reinforced best practices in creating hover and focus states to improve user experience.

One interesting trick I implemented was customizing the hover effect for the social links:

css

Copy
.par p:active {
background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
This ensures a clear visual indication when users interact with the links.

Continued Development
Moving forward, I aim to:

Improve accessibility by ensuring better contrast and keyboard navigation.
Experiment with CSS Grid to compare with Flexbox for layouts.
Optimize the hover and focus states for a more interactive user experience.
